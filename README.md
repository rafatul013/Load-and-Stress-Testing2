Dear viewer, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00. 

1000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 220 And Total Concurrent API requested: 13000.
1500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 320 And Total Concurrent API requested: 19500.
2000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 375 And Total Concurrent API requested: 52000.

While executed 1500 concurrent request, found  4 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.02%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 1800 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries.
